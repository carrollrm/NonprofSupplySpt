Nonprofit supply and citizen demand: A spatial analysis of the market for third sector services The research stream of examining relationships between nonprofit location and various community and market characteristics lacks methodological rigor. This manuscript responds to that deficiency in five ways by 1) improving the nonprofit and market characteristics under examination, 2) introducing more robust, multidimensional constructs for modeling community demand, 3) applying stronger methodologies that account for spatial dependencies, 4) investigating these relationships at the zip code-level, and 5) incorporating replication across three nonprofit industry categories (total, health, and arts expenditures). The specific statistical methodologies applied here involve a spatially dependent Bayesian linear regression model with estimation performed via the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation. Our results indicate consistency across validation nonprofit industry categories and suggest greater nonprofit supply in zip codes with less even markets and greater population. There is also some evidence of less nonprofit supply in zip codes with more community demand. The estimated spatial variation suggests that the western mountain region as well as main metropolitan areas of the state appear to consistently have more residual nonprofit supply. The results obtained can provide further guidance for improvement in this research stream. Keywords: spatial modeling; spatial random effect; nonprofit supply; SOVI; community need
